  Shoaib Alyaan's Website
</h1>
Hello! This is the website I made to showcase my modern web-development skills along with information about myself. I have included my Academic projects, work experience, freelance projects, resume and contact information.

## 🚀 Here's a look at how I made this website and why I choose these technologies.

1.  **GATSBY**

    I used the React framework, **Gatsby**, to build this website as it is known for creating extremely fast loading static sites. I enjoyed working with this framework and would encourage anyone reading this to give **Gatsby** a try as it has a lot of features which makes the mundane tasks related to Web-Development less annoying. (Like image optimisation using **gatsby-image**).

    The added benefit of having starter templates, which gives your project a well defined structure: attractive to beginners.

    ooh it also has **SEO** built in 🎉🎉

    This is the default starter I used.

    ```shell
    # create a new Gatsby site using the default starter
    gatsby new my-default-starter https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default
    ```

2.  **NO Bootstrap/Reused Code**

    All the HTML, CSS and javascript used in this project has been **written by me**. I **did not use** any pre-existing CSS framework or ready-made components as I wanted this to be a showcase of my strong fundamental knowledge.

3.  **gh-pages**

    I used the gh-pages package to automate my production build and deployment process. The command can be seen in the Package.json file named "deploy".

    ```shell
    # Build and Deploy the production build to my gh-pages branch
    gatsby build && gh-pages -b gh-pages -d public
    ```

## Cheers 🍻 🍻
