        <p>
          Easy to use safety device with location tracking and SOS broadcasting
          features. With a small footprint and a single button interface this
          device is meant for women and children. It can also be hung around pet
          collars and used for Alzheimerâ€™s patients.
        </p>
        <p>
          When triggered, the device uses a GPS module to trace the location of
          the area. This data is processed by a microcontroller which then uses
          a GSM module to send a SMS alert to a set of preset guardian numbers.
          The location data once triggered is continuously backed up on an
          online database which can be accessed by the guardians through a login
          ID and password. The device has two operational modes, continuous
          broadcasting and an SOS mode.
        </p>
        <p>
          A particular function of this device is the implementation of
          community security. When a device is triggered the database compares
          the location of the user to the home and last known location of other
          such users and sends them SMS alerts of a community member in danger.
        </p>
        <p>
          The device is equipped with a vibrational motor and a buzzer to alert
          the user of an incoming text message. A piezo electric sensor is also
          attached to the shell of the device in order to alert the guardian if
          the device has been broken.
